### Description
This is a very simply React app built without create-react-app
It was built as part of my Fullstack React coursework (https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/)
My main takeaway with this project is the property initializer feature which allows
the user to bypass the constructor function.

### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install `http-server`

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
OR
http-server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
OR
If you run http-server, the server will run on your-ip-address:8080
